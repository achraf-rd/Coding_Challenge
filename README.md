## Overview

This is a blog application built with the Next.js framework using the app router and Tailwind CSS for styling. The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete blog posts, with support for image uploads via Firebase. MongoDB is used as the database, and Mongoose is employed as the Object Document Mapper (ODM).
